üîç Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Flipkart Product Reviews using Web Scraping and NLP

Description:
This project focuses on analyzing customer sentiments from Flipkart product reviews using web scraping, Python, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The workflow begins with scraping real-time product reviews from Flipkart using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, ensuring structured collection of review text, ratings, and metadata.

After data collection, the reviews undergo data cleaning and preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and text normalization. Using NLP techniques and sentiment lexicons, the project classifies reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Additionally, machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or advanced deep learning models (if applied) can be used to improve classification accuracy.

The analysis provides valuable insights into customer opinions, product performance, and overall user satisfaction. This project demonstrates the integration of web scraping, data analysis, and NLP to extract meaningful information from unstructured textual data, making it useful for e-commerce businesses, product research, and decision-making.
